<h1>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (Beta)</h1>

<p>This README summarizes my journey through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Throughout the course, I gained a solid foundation in JavaScript, from mastering variables, arrays, and objects to understanding functions, loops, and the DOM. I explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, and developed problem-solving skills through algorithmic challenges.</p>

<h2>Projects Completed</h2>

<p>During the course, I built various projects, including a <strong>Pyramid Generator</strong> and a <strong>Gradebook App</strong>, which reinforced my understanding of key concepts. These hands-on experiences were instrumental in deepening my knowledge.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>

<p>I'm excited to continue my learning journey with projects like a <strong>Role Playing Game</strong> and a <strong>Music Player</strong>, which will further enhance my skills in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Certification Projects</h2>

<p>To earn my certification, I will complete key projects like a <strong>Palindrome Checker</strong> and a <strong>Cash Register</strong>, which will demonstrate my proficiency in JavaScript.</p>

<p>This certification marks a significant milestone in my development as a front-end developer, equipping me with the tools and knowledge to tackle real-world web development challenges.</p>
