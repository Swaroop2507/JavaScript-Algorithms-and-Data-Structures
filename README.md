<h1>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (Beta)</h1>

<p>This README summarizes my journey through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Throughout the course, I gained a solid foundation in JavaScript, from mastering variables, arrays, and objects to understanding functions, loops, and the DOM. I explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, and developed problem-solving skills through algorithmic challenges.</p>
